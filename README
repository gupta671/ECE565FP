Evaluating Dynamic Insertion Policy and Signature based Hit Predictor
Rishab Kapil- DIP
Rohan Gupta- SHiP

We integrated both the policies DIP and SHiP in one source code, and built the system having both policies impelemented.
This enabled us to have a one to one comparison of performance of both policies using same system.

We also copied the combined source code into two different directories, one for each partner:
DIP: SOURCE_CODE_RIHSAB_DIP
SHiP: SOURCE_CODE_ROHAN_SHIP
